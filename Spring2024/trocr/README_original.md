# Introduction
This is built on top of the original DETR/CRAFT/TrOCR/TaxoNERD pipeline. Main objective is testing the accuracies of the OCR pipeline and the OCR + NER (by TaxonNERD) on CVH datasets.

# Setup
Refer to README_original.md for detailed instructions. Primarily useage should only focus on trocr_with_detr_label_extraction.ipynb. In order to run this notebook, or using one of its module as script to validate accuracies, please follow the **Deployment instructions**. If problem arise, please refer to the github issue or the huggingface discussions section[https://huggingface.co/spark-ds549/detr-label-detection/discussions/3].
